If you have not played the randomizer, you should check out ["NewPlayer.md"](NewPlayer.md)  
If you have a question, ["FAQ.md"](FAQ.md) might have the answer.  
If you are having trouble with accessing a specific location, there might be a dedicated explanation
within the area-specific guide.  
If you can't find an answer in the guide, or have bumped into an issue, feel free to ask in the
