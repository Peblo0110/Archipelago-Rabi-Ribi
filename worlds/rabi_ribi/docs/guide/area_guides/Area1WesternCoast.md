# Beach guide
## Vanilla guide
Entrances:
 - Forest entrance: Sometimes walled off by constraints, use the UPRPRC warp to get to the right side
 - Ravine entrance: Gives full access to the beach
 - Volcanic entrance: Doesn't give beach access unless you have some extra vertical height
 - Underwater entrance: Gives full access to the beach
 - Drop from sky town: Requires carrot bombs.
There really isn't too much going on for the beach. Most items are out in the open, or require `carrot bomb`.
0% Pack Up Beach:  
If you spam quick drops on the block that contains this item, eventually you will clip far enough into the block to get the item.  
## Constraint guide
# Pyramid guide
## Vanilla guide
Entrances:
 - Opening at the top of the pyramid: pretty obvious...
 - Egg Pyramid Beach: requires a carrot bomb. You can use this entrance to skip one of the rooms in the pyramid proper.
 - Beach slide: Explictly requires slide, as you enter from the right side. This entrance can bypass some constraints.
