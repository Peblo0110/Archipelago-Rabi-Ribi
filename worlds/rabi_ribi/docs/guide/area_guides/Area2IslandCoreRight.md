# Rabi Ravine guide
## Vanilla guide
Entrances:
 - Town: Left side of the ravine. Can be warped to via Cicini fight. See constraints
 - Beach: Right side of the ravine.
Overall there isn't too much going on in the ravine. Most items can be accessed 0%, and the remaining few usually are 
available with carrot bomb. If playing with constraints, there is only one major trick that can help (reverse Chocolate).
