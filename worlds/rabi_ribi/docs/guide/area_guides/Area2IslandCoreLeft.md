# Woodland Park + UPRPRC base guide
## Vanilla guide
Entrances:
 - Tundra: Starts you right beside the warp, allowing you to quickly grab Rabi slippers.
 - Town: puts you right before green Kotri.
This is a fairly tame zone, however a lot of the items are locked behind carrot bomb.  
Rabi slippers without uprprc:  
You can grab the rabi slippers without ever entering the UPRPRC base by doing a reverse wall kick + jump in the cave. Make sure to start your wallkick by 
the window rather than the apex of your jump. If you hit the roof on the first wallkick, then you are doing it too high! There is a constraint that prevents 
this trick.  
0% Egg park green Kotri:  
Requires amulets and food. This trick is awful, deserving the `ADV_STUPID` requirement. A video of this can be found [here](https://youtu.be/PgUgE_HcrnQ?t=478). 
The idea is simple; do a quick drop to get damage boosted against the wall, then do a wallkick and then spam amulets + food to conserve height while getting to the ledge. 
Highly recommend not doing this trick.

# Sky bridge guide
## Vanilla guide
Entrances:
 - Bridge lower: Note that entering above and below the bridge is two different entrances. You have to fight Vanilla to get to/from sky bridge.
 - Bridge upper: Note that entering aobce and below the bridge is two different entrances. This entrance does not require fighting vanilla.
There is only 2 items here that can be grabbed 0% (Egg above Warp Room and Lucky Seven), with most of the other items requiring slide and/or carrot bomb.  
Getting upper bridge entrance:  
There is a secret passage in between the save room and the large 2x2 room before vanilla. You can reverse wall jump + kick to get up this passageway, then walk over the top of 
Vanilla's fight to get to the entrance.  
Egg above Warp room:  
A video for this egg can be found [here](). From the warp room, shoot up and right to reveal a secret passage. Use reverse wall kicks to get up 
to the egg room. You then need to shoot a seccond secret passage slightly to the right of the thwomps to drop a spring. Finally, when bouncing on the spring, 
shoot to the right to break a third secret passage, then walk all the way to the right above the thwomps.  
Regen Up Sky bridge alternative via slide + carrot bomb:  
This ledge can be pretty tight to get to. On basic logic, the ledge requires either `Air Jump` or `Air Dash`, however there is an alternative way to get there via a zip in 
the dark room if you have a method to zip and carrot bomb. In the dark room on the right side, there is a slide hole which will show you `Hex Cancel`. Perform any zip to enter the 
area with `Hex cancel`, then proceed forwards. Instead of sliding out, you can drop down and bomb a wall to get on the other side of the regen up.
