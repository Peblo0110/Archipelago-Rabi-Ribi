# FAQ

## General

Q: Help, I'm stuck!  
A: Open your menu, select inventory, then select the "Strange Box". This should grey it out (Disabled). When you leave the menu, a warp menu should open up.

Q: I warped somewhere weird!  
A: Known issue. Try warping again. If that doesn't work, or you can't warp again, reload your save and report it to the discord channel please.

Q: I'm missing items!  
A: If you picked up the item in your world, the item should still be there to be picked up. If you didn't, please report it in the discord channel.

Q: What are the red blocks behind Miriam's shop?
A: They prevent you from getting a shuffled gift item (bunny strike). To clear them, you have to fight Cicini.

Q: What is the point of the random door in Forest/Town?
A: These are used to repeat warp events, which may be used for logic. There is a similar one in Cicini's room.

Q: UT/poptracker says I can get to X, but I have no items  
A: There is a lot of items that can be accessed with only reverse walljumps and wallkicks. Consult Section 2 of the New Player guide.
A2: As of writing, the poptracker pack does not have logic for entrance shuffle or added constraints. Please use UT for proper tracking.

Q: What is the goal?  
A: Currently, there is only one goal, which is to collect the requisite amount of easter eggs. On default settings, there is 5 to collect within your own world.

Q: I can't use consumables  
A: There is two ways to get access to consumables. The standard way is to get to chapter 1, however in the alternative you may get access by having 3 magic types.

Q: How do I get into Cicini's room?  
A: If you want to get there without items, you need to do green Kotri, forest Cocoa, and have reached at least chapter 1. A spring will appear in the room before cicini if you have done all of those.

Q: There's a rock blocking the way to Charge Ring  
A: Follow the same steps to get to Cicini's room, including getting the spring to drop. When you return, a cutscene will play and the rock will be gone.

Q: I can't get to tough skin

A: There is a few to make note of:
 - The first UPRPRC fight in the forest warps you to the right side of the beach
 - Beating Cicini warps you to the west exit of the Ravine
 - In chapter 2, if you have beaten Cicini, you will be warped to Golden Riverbank when passing by the town save point
